# Advent-of-Code-2021

A repository to hold my attempts at solving 2021's Advent of Code programming problems. Most of my work will be run via Jupyter Notebooks using Python. An emphasis has been placed on readability and code conciseness.

This work has been inspired by Peter Norvig's own solutions to AoC 2016, 2017, and 2018.
